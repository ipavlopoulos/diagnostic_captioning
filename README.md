# Diagnostic Captioning (Medical Image to Diagnostic Text)

Use the Show&Tell Image Captioning Encoder-Decoder method to generate the diagnostic findings/impressions of x-rays (IUXray).
This code is dependent to this repo:
https://github.com/nlpaueb/bio_image_caption/tree/master/SiVL19
and makes several assumptions also made in this paper:

To do: 
a) implement SA&T
b) design/develop various retrieval baselines
c) add MIMIC as a dataset
